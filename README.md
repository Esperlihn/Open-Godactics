# Introduction
I'm working on this project as a resource to make developing maps and quickly playtesting tactics game in Godot. Everything will be written in GDScript and as readable as possible to keep this a useful learning tool. Feel free to suggest features or ideas for me to implement as I continue developing this project!!
